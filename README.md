## Purpose of api_client code
Using the authorisation provided by the BoundlessLove/oauth_server project's code, it connects and communicates with the BoundlessLove/api_server2 project's code. 

*Note: If you fork this code, please add a file called config.php, which contains the ApiKey needed to authenticate to the API Server. This is needed in addition to the oauth_server code's authorisation, in order to communicate with the BoundlessLove/api_server2.*

Enjoy!
